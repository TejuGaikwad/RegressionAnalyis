Project 2: Data Analysis and Salary Prediction using Python

**Description:** Conducted data analysis and salary prediction using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and machine learning techniques. Employed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression models to predict salaries based on various factors.

**Tasks:**
1. Imported necessary libraries and loaded survey data.
2. Cleaned and organized the data, dropping irrelevant columns.
3. Handled missing values and filtered out non-essential rows.
4. Preprocessed categorical variables using label encoding.
5. Built a Linear Regression model for initial prediction.
6. Created Decision Tree and Random Forest models for comparison.
7. Utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of Decision Tree.
8. Saved the best-performing model and label encoders using pickle.
9. Loaded the saved model and label encoders for future predictions.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and label encoding
- Implementation of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model saving and loading with pickle
